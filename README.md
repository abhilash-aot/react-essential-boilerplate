react-essential-boilerplate is a integrated version of all react packages. create scalable react app with this update. All are linked well and maintained scalable folder strecture. .

### Tech

Used a number of packages for scalable applications:

* [react](https://reactjs.org/) - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs!
* [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) - Node-sass is a library that provides binding for Node.js to LibSass.
* [redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) - Official React bindings for Redux.
* [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) - route between you pages.
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
